# Important Notes:
During the process of analyzing the UDP packets generated by the Little_Stars application, connections to servers in China were detected. If you are aware of the type of use you want to give to the cameras and their value is not of importance, relevance or strategic nature, limit the use of them to avoid leaking unwanted audiovisual content to unknown servers.
